Absolutely! Here's the rewritten Part 2 of the practical, focusing on testing API controllers, with unit tests for the `getAllBooks` function of `booksController.js`:

### Week 14 Practical: Ensuring API Quality with Unit Testing (Part 2)

#### Testing API Controllers with Jest

In this section, we'll delve into testing the core of your library API: the controllers. Controllers handle incoming requests, process data, interact with your models, and send responses. Robust controller tests are crucial for verifying that your API functions correctly in various scenarios, including success, error handling, and edge cases. We'll use Jest to create these tests, providing you with a solid foundation for testing your backend logic.

**Writing Tests for the `getAllBooks` Function**

Let's focus on testing the `getAllBooks` function in your `booksController.js` file. Here's how you can create comprehensive unit tests for this function:

1. **Create a Tests Directory:** In the root folder of your project, create a new directory named `tests`. This is where you'll organize all your unit and integration tests.

2. **Create a Test File:** In the `tests` directory (created in Part 1), create a new file named `booksController.test.js`. This is where you'll write your unit tests.

3. **Write the Tests:** Add the following code to `booksController.test.js`:

```javascript
// booksController.test.js

const booksController = require("../controllers/booksController");
const Book = require("../models/Book");

// Mock the Book model
jest.mock("../models/Book"); // Replace with the actual path to your Book model

describe("booksController.getAllBooks", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks(); // Clear mock calls before each test
  });

  it("should fetch all books and return a JSON response", async () => {
    const mockBooks = [
      { id: 1, title: "The Lord of the Rings" },
      { id: 2, title: "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" },
    ];

    // Mock the Book.getAllBooks function to return the mock data
    Book.getAllBooks.mockResolvedValue(mockBooks);

    const req = {};
    const res = {
      json: jest.fn(), // Mock the res.json function
    };

    await booksController.getAllBooks(req, res);

    expect(Book.getAllBooks).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1); // Check if getAllBooks was called
    expect(res.json).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockBooks); // Check the response body
  });

  it("should handle errors and return a 500 status with error message", async () => {
    const errorMessage = "Database error";
    Book.getAllBooks.mockRejectedValue(new Error(errorMessage)); // Simulate an error

    const req = {};
    const res = {
      status: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
      send: jest.fn(),
    };

    await booksController.getAllBooks(req, res);

    expect(res.status).toHaveBeenCalledWith(500);
    expect(res.send).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Error retrieving books");
  });
});
```

**Explanation:**

- **Mocking:** Mocking `Book.getAllBooks` isolates the test from the actual database. It's a common practice in unit testing.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Test Case 1 verifies that `getAllBooks` is called once and the response is as expected when everything goes right.
  - Test Case 2 verifies the error handling; if the model returns an error, the controller should return a 500 status with the error message.
- **Structure:** The `describe` block is for grouping related tests, and the `it` blocks describe individual test cases.

**Exercise: Test `updateBookAvailability` Function**

Now that you've seen how to test `getAllBooks`, it's your turn to apply the same principles to the `updateBookAvailability` function. Remember, you'll be mocking the `Book` model and simulating different request/response scenarios.

**Remember:**

- Use `jest.fn()` and `.mockResolvedValue()` or `.mockRejectedValue()` to set up your mocks.
- Structure your tests using `describe` and `it` blocks to organize your test cases.
- Write clear and concise assertions using Jest's `expect` function.
- Aim for comprehensive test coverage to ensure your controller functions behave as expected in all scenarios.
