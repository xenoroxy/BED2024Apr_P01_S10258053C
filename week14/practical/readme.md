**Week 14 Practical: Ensuring API Quality with Unit Testing**

**Introduction:**

In previous weeks, you collaborated with your team to build a functional library API. This week, we shift our focus to the crucial practice of unit testing. Unit testing helps ensure the reliability and maintainability of your API by verifying that individual components work as expected in isolation. This skill will be highly valuable for Back-end Development.

**Objectives:**

- **Understand:** Grasp the fundamental importance of unit testing in software development and why it's an industry standard.
- **Learn:** Explore Jest, a powerful testing framework for JavaScript, to write effective unit tests.
- **Apply:** Put your knowledge into practice by writing tests for the core components of your library API: controllers and models.
- **Mock Dependencies:** Learn how to mock (simulate) database interactions and other external dependencies to isolate the code you're testing.

**Prerequisites:**

- Completion of the Weeks 11 & 12 library API project.
- Working knowledge of Node.js, Express, and JavaScript.

**Practical Structure:**

1. **Introduction to Unit Testing:**

   - Why is unit testing essential for software quality?
   - Introduction to Jest and its key features.
   - Installing Jest in your project.

2. **Testing API Controllers:**

   - Selecting key endpoints for testing.
   - Writing test cases for different scenarios (success, error handling, edge cases).
   - Mocking database interactions using Jest.

3. **Testing API Models:**
   - Writing unit tests for data validation and business logic in your models.
   - Mocking database operations in model tests.

**Deliverables:**

- **Library API Tests:** A well-structured set of unit tests covering key components of your library API (controllers and models).
- **BED Assignment Application:** Apply your newfound unit testing skills to write tests for the backend of your BED assignment.
- **Demonstration of Understanding:** Clearly demonstrate your understanding of unit testing principles and Jest usage.

**Tips:**

- Don't hesitate to ask for help! Collaborate with your team and instructors.
- Focus on writing clean, readable tests that clearly communicate their purpose.
- Use meaningful test descriptions and assertions.
- Strive for comprehensive test coverage to build confidence in your API's reliability.

Please make sure you've completed all three parts of this practical. This will give you a solid foundation in unit testing and enhance your ability to build high-quality, robust software. By applying these skills to your BED assignment, you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient backend developer. Good luck!
