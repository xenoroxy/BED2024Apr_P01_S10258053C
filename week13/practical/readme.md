## Polytechnic Library API - Extended Practical (Week 13)

**Learning Outcomes:**

By successfully completing this extended practical week, you will gain valuable skills in:

- **Week 13:** Creating clear and comprehensive API documentation using Swagger, enhancing the usability and maintainability of your future APIs.

These skills are highly sought-after in the industry and will equip you to develop high-quality and well-documented APIs for future projects, including your upcoming assignments.

**Collaboration & Self-Directed Learning (Combined Focus):**

This week will emphasize a balance between collaborative learning and self-directed exploration. Utilize the knowledge gained from Weeks 11 & 12, and external resources alongside your team members to solidify your understanding of:

**Week 13: API Documentation with Swagger**

- Node.js and Express API development concepts (collaboratively review)
- Introduction to Swagger for API documentation (explore resources together)
- Specifying API endpoints, data structures, and responses using Swagger (work independently and share findings)
- Integrating Swagger with your Node.js and Express API (collaborate on implementation approach)

**Instructions (swagger.md):**

Read document named `swagger.md` will outline the specific steps and requirements for Week 13. This document will detail:

- **Week 13: API Documentation:**
  - Updates to your existing Node.js and Express code to integrate Swagger for API documentation.
  - Clear and comprehensive Swagger documentation covering all API endpoints, data models, and responses.

**Assessment (Week 15):**

- **Quiz:** A quiz will be conducted in Week 15 to assess your understanding of API documentation concepts covered in Week 13, particularly your knowledge of Swagger. The quiz will likely cover topics like:
  - Specifying API endpoints with Swagger
  - Defining data structures and responses in Swagger
  - Integrating Swagger with your Node.js and Express API

**Teamwork & Support:**

This week encourages active collaboration. Work with your team to:

- Discuss and refresh Node.js and Express API development concepts.
- Explore resources on Swagger together, identifying key functionalities.
- Independently work on specifying API components, then share findings and ensure consistency within the team.
- Collaboratively determine the approach for integrating Swagger with your API.

Don't hesitate to reach out to instructors or classmates for additional help or clarification throughout the week.

**Get Started:**

- **Review Deliverables:** Carefully read the `swagger.md` document for detailed instructions.
- **Explore Resources:** Utilize online tutorials, documentation, and course materials together to grasp Swagger functionalities.
- **Independently Apply Knowledge:** Work on your assigned tasks related to Swagger implementation and documentation.
- **Seek Help & Collaboration:** Discuss challenges and solutions with your team. Don't hesitate to involve instructors or classmates for further support.

**Transferring Knowledge to Assignments:**

The skills you acquire in this practical week are directly applicable to your assignment. By effectively documenting your Polytechnic Library API with Swagger, you'll create a clear and user-friendly resource for yourself and others interacting with your API. This translates to:

- Improved code maintainability for future modifications to your API.
- Enhanced collaboration with teammates who can easily understand the API's functionality through the Swagger documentation.
- A strong foundation for documenting future APIs you develop in your assignment and beyond.

Remember, this combined approach fosters a supportive learning environment while equipping you with valuable collaborative and self-directed learning skills for API development. Apply these skills to create well-documented APIs that excel in clarity and usability.
